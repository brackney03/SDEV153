            <h2>My Projects</h2>
            <p>I have some minor experience doing some very small game dev projects for fun. Here's what I've made!</p>
            <h3>Untitled Top-Down Shooter Game</h3>
            <p>I taught myself how to code in C# using Unity's Unity Learn program, which is a self-guided free tutorial for everything Unity. I had a lot of fun just messing around
                and trying to get things to work, and that's when I realized that making games and coding is what I want to do! Here's a picture of one of the small games I made.
            </p>
            <img src="images/UnityGameScreenshot.png" alt="A screenshot of a small game I made">
            <p>So far, this is the only game I've put a lot of work into. It's a top-down shooter where you run around trying to destroy weird pink aliens. I made it so that 
                when you get hit, you become invincible for about 3 seconds, and if you pick up one of the power-ups (yellow thing near the bottom-middle) you can run into
                the enemies and explode them as you please super-Mario style. One of the more advanced things I had to make was an if-else loop that checks how many waves of
                enemies you have defeated, and to spawn a harder wave depending on that. Here's the code below:
            </p>
            <pre>
            <code>
void Update()
    {
    enemyCount = FindObjectsOfType[Enemy]().Length;
        if (enemyCount == 0)
        {
            waveNumber++;
                Instantiate(powerupPrefab, GeneratePowerupPosition(), powerupPrefab.transform.rotation);
                SpawnEnemyNorth(waveNumber);
                if (waveNumber > 3)
                {
                    SpawnEnemySouth(waveNumber);
                }
                if (waveNumber > 6)
                {
                    SpawnEnemyEast(waveNumber);
                }
                if (waveNumber > 9)
                {
                    SpawnEnemyWest(waveNumber);
                }
        }
    }
            </code>
            </pre>
            <p>
                For my first somewhat big project, I've had a lot of trouble. I still haven't figured out how to get the aliens to stop spastically spinning around because their
                animation is broken. However, I had a ton of fun just making this for practice, and I can't wait to get the opportunity to make some more. Stay tuned!
